47,veritasium,@TomKenyon1 @rjallain current starts at 1/c seconds and from then for the first second is approximately constant.
48,veritasium,@TomKenyon1 @rjallain Truth is the circuit works the same if complete or not. You can send a pulse of current down a wire without seeing if it‚Äôs connected to anything at the end - the changing magnetic field from this current can induce current in nearby wires. So the bulb lights when the fields reach
49,veritasium,@TomKenyon1 @rjallain Even if it‚Äôs incomplete it still lights. Think about the coupling between the wires. They are far apart but also very long.
50,veritasium,@Andrew_Maris @NMcGreivy @Jack_D_Hare current is induced in the bulb by the changing E and B fields

137,veritasium,"@OriginalKanator @Ryan123220 @alexkusenko What is essential to the explanation is that there is relative motion of air over ground. This is what allows thrust to be bigger than drag on wheels. If there is no tailwind, there‚Äôs no mechanical advantage and the thing slows down."
138,veritasium,@OriginalKanator @Ryan123220 @alexkusenko The initial forward motion is caused just by drag as the wind hits it - it‚Äôs a bluff body so the wind gets it rolling (like a block of styrofoam sitting in the desert). Once it‚Äôs rolling then the fan starts pushing back.
139,veritasium,"@ThomasCabaret84 Tough to say - if it‚Äôs close to a minute, we‚Äôll probably give it a look."
140,veritasium,@kilroi22 @CavallaroRick @Laserchalk @alexkusenko Since the speed of the wheels over the ground (V) is higher than prop through air (V-W) the force at the prop can be bigger than the force back on the wheels. Even with losses this still works. All analysis here is done in car‚Äôs frame of reference
141,veritasium,"@kilroi22 @CavallaroRick @Laserchalk @alexkusenko I will hopefully give you something ideal on Wednesday. Power out at the prop is less than power in at the wheels (due to losses) but assume they‚Äôre equal for argument‚Äôs sake. Then:
P=fV at the wheels and 
P=F(V-W) at the prop"

155,veritasium,"@ArrayManta Wager is over the claim: you can go downwind faster than the wind at steady state in a vehicle powered only by the wind

158,veritasium,"@ArrayManta Thankfully the bet is not ""can you go 2.8x wind speed?"" the bet is ""can you accelerate when v&gt;w?"" Alex's claim is you can't.

This has been falsified in GPS data, treadmill thrust data, and you can measure it off the video of me accelerating after I hit windspeed."
159,veritasium,"@ArrayManta The claim there is ""acceleration is slow so models can't reach high speeds relative to the treadmill belt""

The answer is ""slow acceleration given enough time can lead to high speeds relative to the belt. But no one has a long enough treadmill to do this"""

168,veritasium,@ernestosaboia1 Nope. This thing works at steady state.
169,veritasium,"@kilroi22 @LenfesteyMark @pascoscientific Here‚Äôs the thing: power out doesn‚Äôt have to be more than power in. Only force out from the propeller has to be more than force in at the wheels

Power = force x velocity

Since wheels are going much faster over the ground than prop through air, force at wheels lower @ prop higher"
170,veritasium,"@kilroi22 @pascoscientific Can I send you some data? This was actually filmed at 120 FPS. I was counting frames by hand last night. There‚Äôs a nice seam on the wheel, easy for tracking (at least by eye)."
